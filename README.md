# Movie Booking System - Self Booking Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the complete self-booking user story implementation for the movie booking system.

## User Journey Flow
1. **Homepage** - User sees list of movies (screening/coming soon)
2. **Movie Selection** - User finds movie of interest
3. **Schedule Selection** - User selects date, time, and venue
4. **Seat Selection** - User selects preferred seats
5. **Payment** - User pays using RMA Payment Gateway
6. **Confirmation** - User receives movie ticket

## Components Implemented

### 1. Core Models (`/core/models/movie.interface.ts`)
- **Movie**: Complete movie information including status, cast, director
- **Screening**: Show times with theatre and availability info
- **Theatre**: Cinema locations with amenities
- **Seat**: Individual seat with type, price, and availability
- **BookingDetails**: Complete booking information

### 2. MovieService (`/core/services/movie.service.ts`)
Centralized service managing all movie-related operations:

- `processPayment(booking)` - Process payment simulation
- `generateTicket(booking, transactionId)` - Generate final ticket

### 4. Routing Updates (`/public/public.routes.ts`)
New route structure:
```typescript
/                           -> Home page
/select-schedule/:id        -> Movie schedule selection

```
HomePage -> MovieService.getAllMovies() -> Display movies by status
```

### 2. Schedule Selection
```
HomePage -> /select-schedule/movieId -> 
MovieService.getMovieById() + getScreeningsByMovieId() -> 
Display schedules -> Select screening -> /select-seats/screeningId
```

### 3. Seat Selection
```
/select-seats/screeningId -> MovieService.getSeatsForScreening() ->
Display seat map -> Select seats -> /payment
```

### 4. Payment & Booking
```
/payment -> Customer info -> Payment details -> 
MovieService.processPayment() -> MovieService.generateTicket() ->
